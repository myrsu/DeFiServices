Spad is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Near Blockchain and provides some decentralized finance (DeFi) services.

<br />

# Simple idea

The first DeFi service of Spad is a game.
Players transfer value ($Near) to the smart contract during some period.
When the round of the game ends - the smart contract transfers its balance to the winner.
Then, the game starts again.
At this moment, the winner is the player who transferred the most value to the smart contract.

<br />

Contract: uncompleted,
Frontend: not started yet.
